# Cost snapshot

> **This file is generated.** Do not edit it by hand —

What a component page's preview costs to render — measured on the demo the page shows
(`src/app/demos/<id>.demo.ts`), in jsdom, by `bench/previews.bench.ts`. Four readings
are counts, and the gate holds them exactly and in both directions: a wrapper added, a
listener leaked or a second render pass is a change of what a consumer pays, and it is
to be visible in review — the rule the size record follows
([0023](../../docs/decisions/0023-a-tolerance-is-for-a-wobbling-measurement.md)).

Columns: the scene · elements in the document, the host excluded · depth, the longest
path from the host downwards · listeners registered and not taken back once the scene
is stable, on elements, the document and the window alike · renders before the scene
held still.

## The clock

Measured 2026-11-03 on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3612QM CPU @ 2.10GHz (8 cores), node v24.18.0, jsdom 22.1.0.

Microseconds from creation to stable, the median of fifteen rounds after three warm-ups.
A clock wobbles with the machine and the load, so this section is published, dated and
compared by nobody: the gate requires a reading for every scene and holds none of the
values — a tolerance is for a measurement that wobbles, and a band on a record is a
record that ages (0023). Rewritten with every `--write`, so the numbers are of the same
day as the counts beside them. jsdom lays nothing out, so this is the library's own
work — templates, signals, listeners — and not a browser's.
